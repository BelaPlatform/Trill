# Trill: Touch Sensing for Makers

Trill sensors are designed to bring beautiful touch interaction to digital projects. Trill sensors are available now on the [Bela Shop](https://shop.bela.io/collections/trill) and via [Mouser Electronics](https://www.mouser.it/c/sensors/sensor-development-tools/?m=Bela).

## Trill libraries and examples

The Bela IDE comes pre-loaded with the [Trill library](https://github.com/BelaPlatform/Bela/tree/master/libraries/Trill) and [Trill examples](https://github.com/BelaPlatform/Bela/tree/master/examples/Trill).

For other platforms:

- [`Trill-Linux`](https://github.com/BelaPlatform/Trill-Linux) contains the Trill library and examples for Linux systems, such as Raspberry Pi

- [`Trill-Arduino`](https://github.com/BelaPlatform/Trill-Arduino) contains the Trill library and examples for Arduino, as well as Arduino-compatible systems such as Teensy. These also include examples of how to connect your Trill sensor to Processing to generate visuals.

## Trill hardware designs

This repo contains the editable PCB designs and manufacturing files for Trill sensors. You can download these schematic source and PCB design files and edit them yourself using [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/).

### Source Files and Licenses

Trill hardware designs and this datasheet are available under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) License, meaning they can be freely reused and remixed with attribution, provided modifications remain open source.

### Commercial Licensing

It's possible to use Trill design files and firmware for a commercial projects free of charge under [CC-BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) (hardware) and [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) (firmware). Both licenses allow you to use these assets yourself under the license requirements, which include publicly releasing any changes you make to the designs under the same license.

If you want to use Trill design files but not provide attribution and/or not release your source code – for example, because you want to create something to sell using these files but don't want to make your source files public – this is still possible, but requires a commercial license. Augmented Instruments Ltd. can provide you with a commercial license that fits your project and its scope. Get in touch at info@bela.io to discuss your product and the license that's right for you. More information may be found at https://learn.bela.io/products/products-overview/open-source-licenses/#using-trill-in-commercial-products

Please note: The above commercial licensing applies only to modifications to our provided firmware code and PCB designs. You can buy Trill sensors and use them in any commercial or personal project without any additional licensing costs.

## Trill name and logo 

Trill and Bela names and logos are copyright Augmented Instruments Ltd. Any  designs that you release or produce should **not** use the Trill name or logo and/or the Bela name and logo, whether modified or exact copies.

## Datasheet

This repo contains the Trill datasheet. There is one datasheet for all Trill sensors that includes technical diagrams and usage information. 

## Fritzing files

Fritzing parts are available for all Trill sensors, in the [Bela Fritzing repo](https://github.com/belaplatform/fritzing).
